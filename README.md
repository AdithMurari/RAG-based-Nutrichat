# Nutrition Textbook Query System with RAG Workflow
This project aims to develop a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) system utilizing the Retrieve-and-Generate (RAG) workflow. The system enables users to query a vast 1200-page Nutrition Textbook provided in PDF format and receive responses generated by a Language Model (LLM) based on relevant passages from the textbook.

Project Details
PDF Source: Nutrition Textbook PDF
Main Goal: The primary objective of implementing the RAG workflow is to enhance the generation outputs of Language Models (LLMs).
Key Features
Preventing Hallucinations:
LLMs, while powerful, can sometimes generate responses that appear correct but are not factually accurate. The RAG pipeline mitigates this issue by providing factual inputs retrieved from the Nutrition Textbook. Users can access the sources of generated answers to ensure accuracy.
Custom Data Integration:
Many base LLMs are trained on general internet-scale text data, lacking specific domain knowledge. The RAG system addresses this limitation by incorporating domain-specific data, such as medical information from the Nutrition Textbook. This customization allows the system to generate responses tailored to the nutrition domain.
How It Works
Query Input:
Users input their queries related to nutrition topics.
Retrieval Phase:
The system retrieves relevant passages from the Nutrition Textbook PDF based on the user query.
Generation Phase:
The retrieved passages serve as inputs for the LLM, which generates responses based on the retrieved information.
Output:
Users receive generated responses reflecting the information extracted from the Nutrition Textbook.
